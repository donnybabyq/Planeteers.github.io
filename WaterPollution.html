    <p><i>Our group choose animation as our solution for the problem.

We target to spread the awareness of our problem and to give some possible and easy solutions.
.</i></p>
    <h3> CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM</h3>
    <p>One of the causes of throwing garbages in water forms is that the youth are too lazy to throw their garbages in trash bins.
    <p>After they are done eating, they'll throw it to a near waterforms if ever there are some near them.
    <p>Lack of trash bins are also one of the reason, whenever they are on roads or parks.
    <p>Whenever youth have garbages on hands, they do not want to leave it in their bags so what they do is either throw it or leave it anywhere.
    With lack of garbage collectors, people are forced to throw their garbages in rivers or other waterforms.
    </p>
